# 0x01. NoSQL

## Introduction
🔍 **NoSQL** (Not Only SQL) refers to a variety of database technologies designed to handle large volumes of data, different data structures, and distributed data storage.

## Key Characteristics
- 🚀 **High Performance:** Optimized for speed and efficiency.
- 📊 **Scalability:** Horizontally scalable (can add more servers).
- 🛠️ **Flexible Schema:** Allows dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
- 🔀 **Distributed Storage:** Data is distributed across multiple locations.

## Types of NoSQL Databases
1. **Document Store** 📄: MongoDB, CouchDB
   - Stores data in JSON-like documents.
   - Example: `{ "name": "John", "age": 30 }`

2. **Key-Value Store** 🔑: Redis, DynamoDB
   - Data is stored as key-value pairs.
   - Example: `("user123", {"name": "Alice", "age": 25})`

3. **Column Store** 📚: Cassandra, HBase
   - Data is stored in columns rather than rows.
   - Example: `{"user": {"name": "Bob", "age": 35}}`

4. **Graph Store** 🗺️: Neo4j, OrientDB
   - Data is stored in graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties.
   - Example: `User -[FRIEND]-> User`

## Advantages
- 🔄 **Flexibility:** Easily handles diverse data types.
- 💡 **Performance:** Efficient for large-scale data operations.
- 🧩 **Scalability:** Grows seamlessly with data and traffic.

## Use Cases
- **Real-time Web Apps** 🌐
- **Big Data Analytics** 📈
- **Content Management** 📝
- **IoT Applications** 🌍

## Conclusion
NoSQL databases are a powerful alternative to traditional SQL databases, providing flexibility, scalability, and high performance for a variety of modern data storage needs.
